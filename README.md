This project is bootstrapped with **Create React App** and demonstrates the concept of **React custom hooks** — reusable functions that encapsulate logic and can be shared across components.  
Custom hooks help to make components clean, modular, and maintainable.



They allow *reusable logic* and cleaner component code.
