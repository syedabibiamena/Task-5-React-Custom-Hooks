Task 5 – React Custom Hooks

A simple React project built as part of assignment 5 which showcases the use of **React Custom Hooks** to manage reusable logic across components.

Live Demo: https://venerable-bienenstitch-1121a0.netlify.app/

This project is bootstrapped with **Create React App** and demonstrates the concept of **React custom hooks** — reusable functions that encapsulate logic and can be shared across components.  
Custom hooks help to make components clean, modular, and maintainable.

 What Are Custom Hooks?

Custom Hooks in React are JavaScript functions that:

- Start with the prefix `use`
- Can use built-in hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.
- Return values, functions, or state that components can use

They allow *reusable logic* and cleaner component code.

 Project Structure

 project:


You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
